Note- TMS1 does not include monthly sweeps data after 05/02/2012 because of the end of [retail deposit sweeps data](https://research.stlouisfed.org/aggreg/swdata.html) and other data in [institutional money funds and several memorandum items](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H6/h6_technical_qa.htm#:~:text=8.%20Which%20release%20items%20will%20be%20discontinued%20once%20the%20H.6%20statistical%20release%20is%20published%20at%20a%20monthly%20frequency%3F)
